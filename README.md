# SPM Defacer
 SPM defacer script that uses SPM standalone on Docker to deface individual images. Two types of scripts exist, one for defacing  and individual image (spm_deface_file.sh) and the other for defacing a folder and all its subfolders (spm_deface_folder.sh).

 HOW TO USE:
 
 Step 1 - Make sure you have docker desktop installed on you computer.

 Step 2 - Download the appropriate version of the script (either to deface a single image or an entire folder); currently only supports MAC OS or LINUX.  

 Step 3 - Open a Terminal and type in the location of the script, then a space, and then add the location of the NIFTI file or folder you want defaced. MAKE SURE TO INCLUDE THE ENTIRE PATH OF THE FILE OR FOLDER.
